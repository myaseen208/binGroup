  abstract = {The inspection of the individual members of a large population is an expensive and tedious process. Often in testing the results of manufacture the work can be reduced greatly by examining only a sample of the population and rejecting the whole if the proportion of defectives in the sample is unduly large. In many inspections, however, the objective is to eliminate all the defective members of the population. This situation arises in manufacturing processes where the defect being tested for can result in disastrous failures. It also arises in certain inspections of human populations. Where the objective is to weed out individual defective units, a sample inspection will clearly not suffice. It will be shown in this paper that a different statistical approach can, under certain conditions, yield significant savings in effort and expense when a complete elimination of defective units is desired. It should be noted at the outset that when large populations are being inspected the objective of eliminating all units with a particular defect can never be fully attained. Mechanical and chemnicafla ilures and, especially, man-failures make it inevitable that mistakes will occur when many units are being examined. Although the procedure described in this paper does not directly attack the problem of technical and psychological fallibility, it may contribute to its partial solution by reducing the tediousness of the work and by making more elaborate and more sensitive inspections economically feasible. In the following discussion no attention will be paid to the possibility of technical failure or operators' error. The method will be described by showing its application to a large-scale project on which the United States Public Health Service and the Selective Service System are now engaged. The object of the program is to weed out all syphilitic men called up for induction.},

Much of the theoretical framework of group testing was developed starting in the late 1950s, with continued work into the 1990s. Recently, with the advent of new laboratory and genetic technologies, there has been an increasing interest in group testing designs for cost saving purposes. In this paper, we compare different nested designs, including Dorfman, Sterrett and an optimal nested procedure obtained through dynamic programming. To elucidate these comparisons, we develop closed-form expressions for the optimal Sterrett procedure and provide a concise review of the prior literature for other commonly used procedures. We consider designs where the prevalence of disease is known as well as investigate the robustness of these procedures when it is incorrectly assumed. This article provides a technical presentation that will be of interest to researchers as well as from a pedagogical perspective. Sup...},

There have been recent advances in design and estimation, but the simple Dorfman procedure introduced by R. Dorfman in 1943 is widely used in practice. In many practical situations, the exact value of the probability p of being affected is unknown. We present both minimax and Bayesian solutions for the group size problem when p is unknown. For unbounded p, we show that the minimax solution for group size is 8, while using a Bayesian strategy with Jeffreys' prior results in a group size of 13. We also present solutions when p is bounded from above. For the practitioner, we propose strong justification for using a group size of between 8 and 13 when a constraint on p is not incorporated and provide useable code for computing the minimax group size under a constrained p.},

In many applications, the goals include both identifying individuals as positive or negative and estimating the probability of positivity. The identification aspect leads to additional tests being performed, known as " retests, " beyond those performed for initial groups of individuals. In this paper, we investigate how regression models can be fit to estimate the probability of positivity while also incorporating the extra information from these retests. We present simulation evidence showing that significant gains in efficiency occur by incorporating retesting information, and we further examine which testing protocols are the most efficient to use. Our investigations also demonstrate that some group testing protocols can actually lead to more efficient estimates than individual testing when diagnostic tests are imperfect. The proposed methods are applied retrospectively to chlamydia screening data from the Infertility Prevention Project. We demonstrate that significant cost savings could occur through the use of particular group testing protocols.},

In such applications, the goal is often to classify individuals as positive or negative using initial group testing results and the subsequent process of decoding of positive pools. Many decoding algorithms have been proposed, but most fail to acknowledge, and to further exploit, the heterogeneous nature of the individuals being screened. In this article, we use individuals' risk probabilities to formulate new informative decoding algorithms that implement Dorfman retesting in a heterogeneous population. We introduce the concept of "thresholding" to classify individuals as "high" or "low risk," so that separate, risk-specific algorithms may be used, while simultaneously identifying pool sizes that minimize the expected number of tests. When compared to competing algorithms which treat the population as homogeneous, we show that significant gains in testing efficiency can be realized with virtually no loss in screening accuracy. An important additional benefit is that our new procedures are easy to implement.

More recently, there has been a growing set of literature generalizing previous work in group testing to include heterogeneous populations so that each individual has a different risk of positivity. We investigate the effect of acknowledging population heterogeneity on a commonly used group testing procedure which is known as ‘halving'. For this procedure, positive groups are successively split into two equal‐sized halves until all groups test negatively or until individual testing occurs. We show that heterogeneity does not affect the mean number of tests when individuals are randomly assigned to subgroups. However, when individuals are assigned to subgroups on the basis of their risk probabilities, we show that our proposed procedures reduce the number of tests by taking advantage of the heterogeneity.

  abstract = {In situations where individuals are screened for an infectious disease or other binary characteristic and where resources for testing are limited, group testing can offer substantial benefits. Group testing, where subjects are tested in groups (pools) initially, has been successfully applied to problems in blood bank screening, public health, drug discovery, genetics, and many other areas. In these applications, often the goal is to identify each individual as positive or negative using initial group tests and subsequent retests of individuals within positive groups. Many group testing identification procedures have been proposed; however, the vast majority of them fail to incorporate heterogeneity among the individuals being screened. In this paper, we present a new approach to identify positive individuals when covariate information is available on each. This covariate information is used to structure how retesting is implemented within positive groups; therefore, we call this new approach "informative retesting." We derive closed-form expressions and implementation algorithms for the probability mass functions for the number of tests needed to decode positive groups. These informative retesting procedures are illustrated through a number of examples and are applied to chlamydia and gonorrhea testing in Nebraska for the Infertility Prevention Project. Overall, our work shows compelling evidence that informative retesting can dramatically decrease the number of tests while providing accuracy similar to established non-informative retesting procedures.},

  abstract = {As in the real world, statistics could have played a significant role in solving the sci-fi problem in “Battlestar Galactica.” However, the consequences for implementing these procedures might have prematurely stifled fans' enthusiasm for the show because the humanoid Cylons would have been identified earlier. While the series ended in 2009, a prequel, “Caprica,” premieres in 2010. “Caprica” will investigate topics such as how Cylons were first developed by humans. Of course, this makes one wonder if the use of statistical science could have played a role in preventing the Cylon attack on the humans in the first place. One can only hope the producers will ask a statistician to serve as a consultant in the writing of the new show.},
